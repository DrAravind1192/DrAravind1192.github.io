<h4>Exploring the spatial information of cometary emissions and long term monitoring of different cometary bodies</h4>

Further comets are being followed in optical imaging and spectroscopy (low and high resolution). Comets which were observed in long slit spectroscopy during the doctoral research (for general compositional characteristics) are being analysed in depth to explore the spatial variation in different emissions (including presence of hidden ionic emissions due to coincidental orientation of ion tail with the slit direction).
Active collaboration with the TRAPPIST group (Dr Emmanuel Jehin & Co) for long term monitoring of cometary bodies with the help of photometric and spectroscopic observations.
The possibility of using the existing observed data set to compute a new set of parent and daughter scale lengths for different molecules is also being explored.
To extend expertise into different wavelength regimes, the TANSPEC instrument mounted on the 3.6 m DOT telescope in India was used to study comets in the IR regime. Even though the unavailability of windows above 2.5 $\mu m$ restricts us from directly observing the emissions from molecular gases, these observations are being used to analyse the continuum emission to probe the dust particles in detail.

<h4>Observational analysis of Cometary bodies in the Solar System</h4>

Comets, the most primordial remnants of our Solar system, can provide us with immense details regarding the conditions that prevailed during the initial stages. Indian telescopes were utilised for performing low-resolution spectroscopy of 22 comets (including comets from different reservoirs and the interstellar comet 2I/Borisov). High-resolution spectroscopic, imaging, and polarimetric observations were also conducted on a few comets to study these bodies containing pristine volatile materials. The results extracted from these observations were used to learn more about the molecules present, their production rate, column density, dust-to-gas ratio, dust grain parameters, Ortho-to-Para ratio of NH<sub>2</sub>, Green-to-Red doublet ratio of forbidden Oxygen line etc. Further information like the relative molecular abundance or line ratios and their behaviour with heliocentric distances were extracted to realise the individual comet's composition and to get a collective understanding of the variations.
