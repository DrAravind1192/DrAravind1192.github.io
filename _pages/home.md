### Welcome!

Comets, those celestial marvels composed of dust, rock, and ice, hold paramount importance in the field of astronomy and space exploration. Observing comets provides us with invaluable insights into the early stages of our solar system's formation, offering a glimpse into the primordial material from which planets and other celestial bodies emerged. The study of comets also plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate interplay between the Sun and its surroundings, shedding light on the dynamic processes occurring in the outer reaches of our cosmic neighbourhood. Furthermore, comets' mesmerizing tails, created as they approach the Sun, serve as captivating cosmic laboratories, revealing crucial information about the solar wind and the composition of the interplanetary medium. By exploring these celestial nomads, from our Solar system and external Stellar systems, we deepen our comprehension of the universe's origins and evolution, unlocking the secrets that have shaped our existence and potentially providing insights into other planetary systems beyond our own. Join me in the quest to explore the significance of comets and their profound impact on our understanding of the cosmos.

### About me

I am a physicist working in the field of observational astronomy.
I received my undergraduate degree in physics from the Sacred Heart College, Thevara, situated in Kerala, India, in 2013, my post-graduate degree in physics from the Loyola College, Chennai, situated in Tamil Nadu, India, in 2015  and went on to earn my PhD from IIT Gandhinagar by working in Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India in 2023.
Other than research, My passion for sports is an unstoppable force that drives me to new heights of excitement and achievement. Whether it's the thrill of a perfectly executed football goal, the lightning-fast reflexes required in badminton, the camaraderie of a competitive volleyball match, or the precision and finesse of table tennis, each sport ignites a fire within me. The relentless pursuit of excellence and the joy of playing with teammates and alike opponents fuel my dedication to these dynamic and adrenaline-pumping activities. Sports keep me physically fit and teach me valuable life lessons about teamwork, discipline, and resilience. In the sports arena, I find my truest self, where every moment is an opportunity to push my limits and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship.
I am proficient in playing the Mrudangam, an ancient Indian percussion instrument, and well-versed in yoga, nurturing a harmonious balance between rhythm and inner peace.
