  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  Comet 2I/Borisov is the first true interstellar comet discovered. Here, we present results from observational programs at two Indian observatories, 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle (HCT) and 1.2 m telescope at the Mount Abu Infrared Observatory (MIRO). Two epochs of imaging and spectroscopy were carried out at the HCT and three epochs of imaging at MIRO. We found CN to be the dominant molecular emission on both epochs, 2019 November 30 and December 22, at distances of rH = 2.013 and 2.031 au, respectively. The comet was inferred to be relatively depleted in Carbon bearing molecules on the basis of low C2 and C3 abundances. We find the production rate ratio, Q(C<sub>2</sub>)/Q(CN) = 0.54 &pm; 0.18, pre-perihelion and Q(C<sub>2</sub>)/Q(CN) = 0.34 &pm; 0.12 post-perihelion. This classifies the comet as being moderately depleted in carbon chain molecules. Using the results from spectroscopic observations, we believe the comet to have a chemically heterogeneous surface having variation in abundance of carbon chain molecules. From imaging observations, we infer a dust-to-gas ratio similar to carbon chain depleted comets of the Solar system. We also compute the nucleus size to be in the range 0.18 km &le; r &le; 3.1 km. Our observations show that 2I/Borisovâ€™s behaviour is analogous to that of the Solar system comets.

  <h3>Dark matter and the strong CP problem</h3>

  <p class="authors">J. M. Cline</p>
  <p>Note: arXiv:2006.08594</p>
  <p>DOI: 2006.08594</p>

  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  The strong CP problem is a puzzle of the Standard Model of particle physics, which is solved by the Peccei-Quinn mechanism. This mechanism predicts a new particle, the axion, which is a dark matter candidate. The axion is a very weakly interacting particle, and its properties are determined by the scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking. This scale is not known, but it is constrained by astrophysical and cosmological observations. The axion is a leading candidate for the dark matter of the universe, and it may be detected in the near future.
