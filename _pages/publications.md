  <h3>Feynman lectures on the strong interactions</h3>

  <p class="authors">R. P. Feynman and J. M. Cline</p>
  <p>Note: arXiv:2006.08594</p>
  <p>DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab084">10.1093/mnras/stab084/clickhere</a></p>

  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  These twenty-two lectures, with exercises, comprise the extent of what was meant to be a full-year graduate-level course on the strong interactions and QCD, given at Caltech in 1987-88. The course was cut short by the illness that led to Feynman's death. Several of the lectures were finalized in collaboration with Feynman for an anticipated monograph based on the course. The others, while retaining Feynman's idiosyncrasies, are revised similarly to those he was able to check. His distinctive approach and manner of presentation are manifest throughout. Near the end he suggests a novel, nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory in D dimensions. Supplementary material is provided in appendices and ancillary files, including verbatim transcriptions of three lectures and the corresponding audiotaped recordings.

  <h3>Dark matter and the strong CP problem</h3>

  <p class="authors">J. M. Cline</p>
  <p>Note: arXiv:2006.08594</p>
  <p>DOI: 2006.08594</p>

  <h4>Abstract:</h4>
  The strong CP problem is a puzzle of the Standard Model of particle physics, which is solved by the Peccei-Quinn mechanism. This mechanism predicts a new particle, the axion, which is a dark matter candidate. The axion is a very weakly interacting particle, and its properties are determined by the scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking. This scale is not known, but it is constrained by astrophysical and cosmological observations. The axion is a leading candidate for the dark matter of the universe, and it may be detected in the near future.
